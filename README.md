# Recipe Generator App

This is a full-stack web application that generates recipes based on a specified food item and calorie count. The backend is built with Python and Flask, while the frontend is built with React.

## ðŸ›  Backend

The backend is a Flask application that uses the OpenAI API and Replicate API to generate recipes and images, respectively. Here are the main features:

- **OpenAI API Integration**: The application uses the OpenAI API to generate recipes based on the provided food item, calorie count, and language.
- **Replicate API Integration**: The application uses the Replicate API to generate an image of the specified food item.
- **Environment Variables**: The application uses environment variables to store API keys and other sensitive information. You'll need to create a `.env` file and populate it with the required variables (see `.env.example` for reference).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeldinRadoncic/RecipeGeneratorBackend.git
